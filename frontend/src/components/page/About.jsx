              We are Chakriya and Khannchy, and we are so excited to share this
              message with you. Together, we've created Cosmitic Store, a
              website as part of our study project.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through this project, we're exploring the process of building a
              website inspired by the vision of a women-owned business. Our
              concept features Korean skincare and makeup, and other beauty
              accessories. We are also dedicated to including Cambodian brands
              to show our support for local businesses.
            </p>

            <p>
              While this is a study project, we are working hard to make it feel
              as realistic and user-friendly as possible, presenting a glimpse
              of how an online beauty store might operate.
            </p>

            <p>
              We hope this project becomes a place you can imagine trusting for
              every beauty product you need. Your feedback means the world to
              us, as it helps us grow and improve.
